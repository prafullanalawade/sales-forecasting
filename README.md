# Sales Forecasting Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using historical sales data. The objective is to analyze past sales patterns and build a machine learning model that can accurately predict future demand, helping businesses improve planning and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand historical sales trends and seasonality
- Clean and preprocess time-series sales data
- Apply machine learning algorithms for sales forecasting
- Evaluate models and select the best-performing one
- Visualize actual vs predicted sales

## 📊 Dataset Description
- Historical sales data containing date-wise sales information
- Features include time-related variables such as day, month, and year
- Target variable: Sales amount

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor

## 🏆 Best Performing Model
- **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy of approx. 0.79 and lowest error compared to other models.
- Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as **R² Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature engineering (date-based features)
4. Model training and testing
5. Model evaluation and comparison
6. Sales prediction and visualization

## 📈 Results & Insights
